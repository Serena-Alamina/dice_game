# Tuple Out Dice Game Consolidation Project

## Overview

The Tuple Out Dice Game is a multiplayer game where players take turns rolling three dice to score points. The objective of the game is to score the most points within 5 turns or be the first player to reach a specified target score.

## Rules

1. The game can be played by one or more players.

2. Each turn, the active player rolls three dice:
- If all three dice show the same number, the player has "tupled out" and ends their turn with zero points.
- If two dice have the same value, they are "fixed" and cannot be re-rolled.
- The player can re-roll any dice that are not "fixed" as many times as they like until they decide to stop or "tuple out".

3. When a player decides to stop rolling, they score points equal to the sum of the three dice, and their turn ends.

4. If a player "tuples out", their turn ends, and they score 0 points for that turn.

5. The game continues for a maximum of 5 turns per player.

6. The player with the highest score after 5 turns, or the first player to reach the specified target score, wins the game.

7. After each turn, the player's score is displayed.

8. The game continues until a player reaches the target score or the maximum number of turns (5) is reached.

9. If no player reaches the target score, the player with the highest score after 5 turns is declared the winner.
